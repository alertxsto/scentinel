"""RDF suitability and exposure-threshold assessment from recorded gas data.

Two outputs, both computed from data the pipeline actually has:

* **Exposure thresholds** — the peak sampled concentration of each gas against a
  published occupational limit. Only gases with a defensible limit are checked;
  a gas with no published limit is reported as unchecked rather than given an
  invented one.
* **Halogen and sulfur loading** — the gas-phase chlorine and sulfur carried by
  the AP-42 Table 2.4-1 trace species, in mg/Nm³. This is the emission potential
  of the waste, not the fuel-basis composition an RDF offtaker buys.

The fuel-basis properties an EN 15359 / ISO 21640 class needs — net calorific
value, ash, and chlorine as a percentage of dry mass — require a laboratory
analysis of the material itself. They are reported as needing that analysis and
never estimated here: the gas phase cannot tell you the mass of the fuel, so any
number derived from it would be a fabrication.

Provenance for every limit and atomic count is in ``docs/references.md``.
