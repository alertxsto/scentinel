"""Decision recommendation: one actionable line, traceable to its inputs.

This is the output the user called the most important one — *"recommended for RDF
after moisture reduction"*. Two properties make it trustworthy:

* **It cites its reasons.** Every recommendation carries the inputs and the rule
  that produced it, so a reviewer can disagree with the reasoning rather than
  with an assertion.
* **It refuses to answer when it cannot.** A batch missing the inputs a route
  needs yields "not enough information" plus the list of what is missing. A
  recommendation built on absent data would be the most damaging kind of output
  this tool could produce.
