"""Batch mass balance: what a load becomes, in tonnes.

The user's expected output is tonnage per stream ("10 t in -> 6.4 t RDF"). This
module is that arithmetic and nothing more: it routes each material to a process
by an explicit split fraction, and it accounts for every kilogram.

Two disciplines are load-bearing:

* **Mass closes.** Every stream is reported, including moisture and residue, and
  the sum equals the input. A balance that quietly loses mass is worse than no
  balance.
* **Every split fraction carries its provenance.** Routing is a *process*
  property, not a physical constant. Where no citation exists the fraction is
  labelled a user assumption, exactly as manual gas sources already are.
