"""Route suitability scoring and RDF quality.

Scores answer *"how suitable is this batch for route X?"*. The discipline that
makes them trustworthy is that **every score is a stated rule over named inputs,
and a score missing an input is not a number**.

Fuel-basis quality — net calorific value, ash, chlorine as a fraction of dry
mass — is what an RDF offtaker actually buys, and it cannot be derived from the
gas phase: the gas does not know the mass of the fuel. Those values therefore
come from one of two places, never a guess:

* a **laboratory measurement** the user enters, or
* a **cited correlation** from composition, if one exists.

No correlation is currently in the repository, so the code offers the laboratory
path and reports the correlated path as unavailable. That is a deliberate gap,
not an oversight: see ``docs/gas-composition-basis.md`` section 6.4.
