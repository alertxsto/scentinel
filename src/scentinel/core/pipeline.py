"""End-to-end batch assessment: waste in, decision out.

One entry point that runs the whole chain — composition → phase → generation →
mass balance → suitability → recommendation — so callers cannot accidentally
skip a stage or read a later result without the earlier one.

The chain is deliberately linear and pure: no Qt, no solver, no I/O. That makes
it testable against hand-checked numbers, which is the only way the output can be
claimed accurate.
