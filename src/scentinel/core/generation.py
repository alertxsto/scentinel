"""Gas generation from waste composition, by the EPA's own regulatory model.

Implements Equation HH-1 of 40 CFR §98.343(a)(1):

    G_CH4 = Σ_x W_x · MCF · DOC · DOC_F · F · (16/12)
            · ( e^(-k(T-x-1)) - e^(-k(T-x)) )

That equation describes annual generation from waste placed in year ``x``. This
module applies the same first-order decay to a single batch of known mass and
known age, which is the question the app actually asks: *what is this load
producing, and how fast?*

Three quantities are kept distinct, because conflating them is what made a
fresh load read like a landfill:

* **Ultimate potential** — what the batch could produce if every degradable
  tonne decayed: :func:`ultimate_methane_yield` and :func:`ultimate_carbon_kg`.
  A property of the composition and the tonnage, not of the age.
* **Cumulative generated** — what has been produced by ``age_h``:
  ``Generation.ch4_cumulative_kg``. Monotone in age, zero at zero age.
* **Instantaneous rate** — what is being produced *now*:
  ``Generation.ch4_rate_kg_per_h``. The exact derivative of the cumulative
  curve, so the two can never disagree.

The produced gas is split by the regulation's own default methane fraction,
``F = 0.5`` (Table HH-1 to Subpart HH), at every age. The AP-42 p.2.4-3
steady-state mix (55% CH4 / 40% CO2 / 5% N2) is a *measured mature-landfill*
composition; it is retained here as a ceiling and a comparison, never as the
mixture the model produces. N2 is not a decay product and is not reported.

Because the split does not depend on age, the generation curve is continuous:
no phase boundary switches methane on or off. The phase label
(:func:`composition.phase_for`) is recorded as an interpretation of the curve
and gates no number.
