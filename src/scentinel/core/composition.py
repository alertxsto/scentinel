"""Waste composition and decomposition phase.

The model describes *waste*, not gas. A batch is seven mass fractions plus a
holding time; the gases follow from those. This is the layer that replaces the
single ``waste_type`` label and the uncited linear scaling that used to sit in
:mod:`scentinel.core.scenario`.

Every constant here is copied from Table HH-1 to Subpart HH of 40 CFR Part 98
(revision at 89 FR 31940, effective 2025-01-01). The table's own footnotes
govern how the ``k`` range is collapsed to one value; see :func:`decay_rate`.
Provenance for the whole chain is in ``docs/gas-composition-basis.md``.
